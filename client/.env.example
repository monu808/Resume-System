# Client Environment Variables

# API URL (optional - defaults to relative URLs in production, localhost:5000 in development)
# Only set this if you need to override the default behavior
# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000

# For local development, you typically don't need to set VITE_API_URL
# The app will automatically use:
# - Production (Vercel): Relative URLs (e.g., /api/auth/login)
# - Development: http://localhost:5000
